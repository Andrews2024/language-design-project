# language-design-project
This project is intended to create a programming level targeted towards new programmers. The motivation of this project is to provide an alternative to the language Racket, which is used in WPI's introductory computer science classes for computer science majors. 
### To Do:
1) Structure parsing program in pseudocode
2) List out necessary parsers (to be put together)
3) Create those parsers and put them together
4) Start testing the parser on example code files
5) Organize and comment code (make a system for this too)
